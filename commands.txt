1. The select statement 
	select <column_name>, <column_name> from <table_name>
	e.g. select pro_id, prod_name, prod_price from Products;
  (1) select * from Products;
  (2) select * from Products limit 5;

2. Ways to constrain the numebr of results
  (3) distinct qualifier  -- this will output distince data within the table
	with distinct: 
		select distinct vend_id from products;
		select distinct vend_id, pro_price from products;
		-- always put distinct before any column and it will apply to all the following columns.
  (4) where clause

3. Comments
(1) -- after two hyphens, it will be a comment
(2) # this make an entire line comment
(3) /* */ 

Practice 1.1: 
# schemas = database
1. select all colums from table orders and only display 5 records 
	sol'n: selsect * from orders;
2. only want to check city and province from table orders
	sol'n: select city, province form orders
3. want to check different city in table orders
	sol'n: select distinct city form orders: 
4. comment out one of the query you juse wrote down
	sol'n: use # or -- or /* */
